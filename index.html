					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>Hi, I’m Utku Efe Ayan. I’m a Game Development major at UC Santa Cruz. All throughout high school, my main focus was on programming, mostly working with Unity and JavaScript. Since starting college, I’ve been working to expand my skill set, especially into the artistic side of game development, like pixel art, level design with Tiled, and experimenting with Unreal Engine.
<br/>
Right now I’m working on a personal project in Unreal Engine 5. I’ve been collecting assets for a while now, and I’m finally starting to pull everything together. I’ve also been learning about generative systems in this class, which I’ve found really interesting and exciting. it’s given me a lot of new ideas for future projects.
<br/>
Outside of game dev, I like reading, playing games, and generally messing around with creative tools and systems.</p>
