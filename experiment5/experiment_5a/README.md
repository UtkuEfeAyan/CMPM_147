This is the simpler version I made to make sure I was following the rules of the assignment.
It still builds an image over time using circles that are colored based on a reference photo, and it mutates to improve accuracy. 
It doesn’t have the inputs or extra customization/features, but it covers the core requirements.
Which from my understanding are mutation, evaluation, and progression.

This version was mostly for safety, just in case my more complex idea (experiment_5b) didn’t align with the assignment format.


I should edit my README.md file to include an artist's statment.(I Shall)
