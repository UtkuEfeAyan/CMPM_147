        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>For this experiment, I wanted to make a generator that feels like an image is slowly forming over time—not instantly shown, but built through layers of mutated shapes. 
          My idea was to start with large, soft circles and then keep adding smaller, more specific ones as time passed. Basically, create something that slowly becomes more recognizable and detailed. 
          But then I realized the assignment wanted more user control and mutation-based interaction, so I made two versionsThis ones which is more straightforward and fits the assignment exactly (experiment_5a)
  </p>
      </div>

      <div class="minor-section">
        <h2>Technical</h2>
        <p>I built a visual mutation system that draws transparent circles onto a canvas to try to match a target image. 
          You can control mutation cycle speed, this is controlled through sliders so the viewer shapes the process directly. 
          There's also a live score tracking (based on color matching error to the target image). 
          </p>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>This was the experiment I spent the most time on by far. It started simple, but I kept wanting to add more to it—more control, more feedback, more personality so i decidec to create 5b  as well whichis more developed an dhave more controlls.
           I liked the idea of the user being able to see an image “emerge" out of nothign so that swhy i did the part b mainly. part 5a is mostly a prototype or baseline for part 5b.</p>
