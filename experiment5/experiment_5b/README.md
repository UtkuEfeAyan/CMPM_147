This is the more complex version of my project.
The idea was to have an image slowly build up and become recognizable over time using randomly generated circles.
But I didn’t want it to just be passive, I wanted the viewer to shape how it evolved.
So I added a bunch of inputs that let you control how the picture grows, how soft or sharp it looks, and how intense the mutations are.

Mutation Threshold – how often new circles are added

New Circles per Mutation – how many new ones are added each time

Min/Max Radius – how big or small the circles can be

Min/Max Transparency – how foggy or sharp the circles are

Mutation Rate – how much things change per frame

Max Total Circles – how many circles you want to allow (helps control FPS)

Circle Counter – shows how many are currently on screen

Everything updates live, and you can mess with the sliders as it runs.
