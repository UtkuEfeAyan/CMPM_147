				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p> I wanted to create a randomized adventure quest that feels like the opening dialog of a video game, based on my birth country, Turkey.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>I categorized the adventure into 11 different segments. Each segment had a list of possible options fitting the theme, so when creating a new quest, the program would randomly pick one item from each category. This made sure the adventure still made sense instead of being totally random nonsense.Then, I created a reroll button placed at the top left corner. When clicked, it would trigger the randomizer again, generating a completely new adventure scenario by selecting different random elements from each category.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I camed up with an idea I liked early making my job easier, At first, it was tricky to balance randomness with coherence. If everything was too random, the generated quests didn’t make sense. then I realized that I needed to catagorzie the randomness for less chaos. The final project worked well the reroll button generated different adventures with a good variety each time. It felt satisfying to see the system create fun combinations I hadn’t even planned for</p>
