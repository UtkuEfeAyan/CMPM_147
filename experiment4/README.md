_A lone red piece starts at the bottom of the board and marches upward towards the opposite side where he anticipates the granting of [king](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draughts#Kings) status in this infinite checkers variation._

The white/brown board and red/black simple cylinder pieces are inspired by [this image](https://appgrooves.com/cdn/mc/GAME_BOARD/1_w1200.jpg).

# Taste of Infinity

The board extends infinitely, but you won't notice it at first.

# Variation in Space

The placement of **capturable** opponent pieces is randomized with a moderate density that sometimes allow long chains of captures and sometimes presents impenatrable walls.

# Variation in Key

Different world keys will lead to different opponent piece scatterings. Perhaps this key made it impossible for you to proceed. Will you be luckier with another? No. You'll never be king.

# Signs of Life

The board is quite dead on its own (no ambient animation). As you mouse around looking for legal moves to advance, your piece quickly jumps to attention. When you move (and possibly capture), the camera surges forward to give you a better view of what is coming up. The only life in this world is what you bring to it.
