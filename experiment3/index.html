        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          In this experiment, I wanted to create a world full of islands that have a variety of sizes, biomes, and inhabitants. 
	The mai inspirations for this project were the world of Legend of Zelda: windwaker, as I thought that a pixel map where you go from island to
        Island could be made and would be fun even though I didn't force it to make an island every time 
	Just when it want so create multiple color tiel ground it needs to islandize them.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="minor-section">
        <h2>Technical</h2>
        <p>
          The generator will randomly decide how many islands to create, based off of the size of the canvas. Then for each island, it will create a
          randomly sized island based on how many islands will populate the screen. The more islands, the smaller they become. After determining
          each island's size, we then randomly select the biome by assigning it to the grid. Afterwards, the grid will then draw the map, first by
          layering the ocean, then autotiling the islands in, and then finally, add the houses randomly on valid terrain
        </p>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          The most difficult part of this experiment was actually trying to understand my implementation of the auto-tiler. I got lost many times
          trying to figure out which direction corresponded to what bit, and later on, got even more confused at trying to figure out which code
          corresponded to which orientation, which made pixel mapping annoyingly difficult.
